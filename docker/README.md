# Docker

## Quick Start

```bash
# Copy and configure developer inputs. Set MNEMONIC for local signet mining.
cp .env.example .env

just docker-seq-up
just docker-seq-down
```

## Architecture

The primary local stack is split into two compose files:

| Compose | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `compose-signet.yml` | Local signet `bitcoind` miner or fullnode |
| `compose-ol-el-seq.yml` | OL sequencer, external `strata-signer`, and EE sequencer |

Bitcoin is decoupled from the OL/EE stack. `just docker-seq-up` starts signet, runs `gen-params-and-elfs.sh`, then starts the sequencer stack. Generated keys, params, and env files live under `configs/generated/` and are ignored by git.

The external `strata-signer` reads the sequencer admin bearer token from
`STRATA_ADMIN_RPC_TOKEN`, so deployments do not need to hardcode that secret in
the signer config TOML.

The retained secondary compose files have narrower test/debug purposes:

| Compose | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `compose-fullnode.yml` | Local Alpen fullnode stack with signet `bitcoind`, checkpoint-sync, and Alpen EE fullnode |
| `compose-checkpoint-sync.yml` | Checkpoint-sync OL node; use with a signet fullnode and mount pre-generated params under `configs/generated/` |
| `docker-compose-eest.yml` | Ethereum execution spec test environment |
| `docker-compose-p2p-test.yml` | Minimal EE P2P/gossip test |

For operator-style fullnode validation, use `compose-fullnode.yml` so the local
Signet fullnode, checkpoint-sync node, and Alpen EE fullnode share one compose
project and network.

Create the fullnode environment file before starting that stack:

```bash
cp .env.alpen-fullnode.example .env
# Edit .env for the target network, image tag, Signet peer, and Alpen EE peer.
```

Prepare the required files that are mounted by the checkpoint-sync and Alpen
fullnode services:

```bash
mkdir -p configs/generated

openssl rand -hex 32 > configs/generated/jwt.hex
sudo chown 10001:10001 configs/generated/jwt.hex
sudo chmod 600 configs/generated/jwt.hex
```

Copy the target network params into `configs/generated/ol-params.json` and
`configs/generated/asm-params.json` before starting the stack.

If the fullnode images are not already available locally or in a registry,
set local image names in `.env`:

```bash
ALPEN_IMAGE=alpen-client:local
CHECKPOINT_SYNC_IMAGE=strata-checkpoint-sync:local
```

Then build them from this checkout:

```bash
docker compose -f compose-fullnode.yml build strata-checkpoint-sync alpen-fullnode
```

Then start the fullnode stack:

```bash
docker compose -f compose-fullnode.yml up -d
```

Before running host-shell checks that reference values from `.env`, export the
file into the current shell. Docker Compose reads `.env` automatically, but
commands such as `bitcoin-cli -rpcuser="$BITCOIND_RPC_USER"` do not.

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
docker compose -f compose-fullnode.yml exec bitcoind bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcuser="$BITCOIND_RPC_USER" -rpcpassword="$BITCOIND_RPC_PASSWORD" getblockchaininfo
```

## Just Recipes

| Recipe | Description |
|---|---|
| `just docker-seq-up` | Start signet + sequencer stack |
| `just docker-seq-down` | Stop everything |
| `just docker-signet-up` | Start signet only |
| `just docker-signet-down` | Stop signet only |
| `just docker-seq-build` | Rebuild sequencer images |

## Without Just

For controlled image builds, step-by-step debugging, or running individual services, use the commands behind the just recipes in `.justfile` under `group('docker')`.

## With remote Bitcoin

Set `BITCOIND_RPC_URL` in `.env` to the remote endpoint and run `just docker-seq-up` as usual. The init service connects to whatever `BITCOIND_RPC_URL` points to.
